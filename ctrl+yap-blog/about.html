    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about-page-content">I'm just a girl who wanted to learn HTML and needed an excuse to actually build something. This is that excuse. Nothing fancy, nothing deep, just me messing around with code and seeing what sticks.
    The site? A project. The stuff I write on it? That just kind of happened. I needed content so I started writing and turns out I had a lot to say. Some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't, most of it I wrote at an ungodly hour.
    That's it. That's the about page. Go read the posts or something.</p>

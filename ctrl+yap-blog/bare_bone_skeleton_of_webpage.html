     document then give them this. -->

         browser how to represent all the characters. It interprets / represents the characters, emojis, or alphabets 
         that we send to the browser as a set of actual zeros and ones that it's gonna use to encode that so that 
         it can display them correctly. -->

          on to our thin and narrow mobile screens -->

            <h2 class="title">I Skipped Zootopia for 9 Years</h2>
            <h4 class="author">M S Anjana</h4>
            <h5 class="posted-date">Dec 8, 2025</h5>
            <img class="blog-image" src="zootopia2.png" alt="Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde taking a selfie together, 
            Judy grinning excitedly while Nick looks reluctantly amused"/>
            <p class="caption">I never really had the interest to watch Zootopia when I was a kid back in 2016. 
                I just assumed it was going to be another generic animated movie about talking animals, so I 
                skipped it without a second thought. Then recently, I stumbled across a scene from Zootopia 2 
                that hit me with an unexpected emotional punch, and that's when I decided to finally give the 
                first one a shot.</p>
            
            <p>Dude, trust me, the plot was so good. I loved how they managed to weave real social commentary 
                about racism and prejudice into a movie meant for kids without making it feel forced. The whole 
                Night Howler storyline is basically an allegory for fear mongering and how easily people can be 
                turned against each other. Judy Hopps is the kind of protagonist you genuinely root for, ambitious, 
                flawed, and determined to prove everyone wrong. And Nick Wilde? The sarcastic fox hiding years of 
                pain behind a smirk? Their chemistry together is honestly what carries both films.</p>
            
            <p>And can we please talk about that scene? The one where Judy and Nick finally confess their feelings
               for each other? I honestly don't even know how to put into words what I felt watching it. 
               The way it was built up, the tension, the vulnerability from both of them, There was this warm, 
               fuzzy, almost overwhelming feeling in my chest. I ship them so bad it's almost embarrassing.
               They're the kind of pair where you just know they belong together and the fact that an animated 
               movie about talking animals had me this emotionally invested says everything about how well these 
               characters are written. </p>

            <h2 class="title">The Art of Giving a Damn</h2>
            <h4 class="author">M S Anjana</h4>
            <h5 class="posted-date">Jan 1, 2026</h5>
            <img class="blog-image" src="stevejobs.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs smiling and gesturing on stage during an
            Apple keynote, with the Apple logo in the background"/>
            <p class="caption">I've always been fascinated by early Apple. Not in a fangirl kind of way where I think
                they can do no wrong, but in the way you admire something that was clearly built by someone who genuinely,
                obsessively cared. Steve Jobs got furious over the shade of yellow on a gradient. A gradient. That level
                of obsession is terrifying and inspiring in equal measure.</p>

            <p>And the engineering, okay, this is the part that really gets me. The way Apple treats hardware and software
                as one unified thing, where every component talks to every other component because they were literally made
                for each other? That's not just smart engineering. That's a whole philosophy. The idea that technology should
                feel invisible, that the best design is the one you don't even notice because it just works. Most companies
                still haven't figured that out and Apple was doing it decades ago.</p>
            
            <p>But here's what honestly humbles me every time I think about it. It started in a garage. Not some fancy lab,
                not a billion-dollar campus, A GARAGE. Two guys with a soldering iron and the audacity to think they could
                change the world. And they actually did. That's the part that sticks with me. Every revolution, every empire,
                every product that changed how we live, it all started with someone just deciding to start.</p>
            
            <p>I think Steve Jobs' real legacy isn't even the iPhone or the Mac. It's that he made people care about design who never
                thought about design before. He had this vision for what technology could feel like, not just what it could do.
                He took a computer company and turned it into a cultural force and I don't think we fully appreciate how insane that is.</p>

            <h2 class="title">I Might Be Crazy</h2>
            <h4 class="author">M S Anjana</h4>
            <h5 class="posted-date">Feb 12, 2026</h5>
            <img class="blog-image" src="crazy.jpg" alt="A top down illustration of a cluttered creative workspace featuring a laptop
            with code on screen, an open sketchbook filled with character design drawings, a VR headset, tangled earphones, a half empty
            coffee mug, a drawing tablet, scattered sticky notes, pens, and a desk lamp casting warm light over everything."/>
            <p class="caption">I have way too many interests and honestly, it's a mess. Web dev, game dev, XR dev, AI/ML, 3D modeling and animation, I kind of want to do all of it.
            I know how that sounds. Like someone who can't commit. Someone just picking up bits and pieces of every discipline, trying something for a few weeks, burning out,
            abandoning it, and then circling back like a hamster on a wheel. And maybe that's exactly what I am. But let me explain why I haven't stopped.</p>
        
            <p>Some days I feel like everything connects, like web dev teaches me logic that helps with game UI, 3D modeling feeds into virtual environments
            and understanding AI opens up possibilities in literally all of it. Other days I feel like I'm just collecting hobbies I'll never actually be good at.
            I don't have some master plan where it all comes together. I'm just... trying stuff. Badly, most of the time. </p>

            <p>I'd rather be this chaotic mess of half attempted skills than someone who never bothered to start. So that's where I am. No roadmap, no clear direction,
            just a lot of open tabs and the hope that eventually some of this starts making sense.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Having a Dog Is Like Living With an Animated Character</h2>
            <h4 class="author">M S Anjana</h4>
            <h5 class="posted-date">Feb 15, 2026</h5>
            <img class="blog-image" src="daijin.jpg" alt="A beagle lounging on a tiled floor with his paws stretched out, looking up at the camera with big curious eyes,
            a pink pillow and a purple ball toy nearby."/>
            <p class="caption">There's something nobody warns you about when you get a dog. They don't just exist in your life, they perform in it. The exaggerated expressions,
            the dramatic flops onto the floor when they're bored, the head tilts like they're deeply processing your words when really they just heard "outside" and nothing
            else matters anymore. The zoomies that come out of nowhere with zero trigger and zero warning like someone hit fast forward on a Looney Tunes episode. Dogs don't
            operate on human logic. They operate on cartoon logic.</p>
            
            <p>And the emotional range? Unmatched. A dog can go from the saddest face you've ever seen because you said "no" to pure unfiltered joy because you picked up the leash,
            all within three seconds flat. No human transitions that fast. That's animation pacing. My dog has beef with one specific pillow in the house. Not all pillows.
            Just one. An ongoing rivalry I'm not part of and will never understand.</p>

            <p>But here's the thing about living with a cartoon character. They don't just make you laugh, they make you feel things you weren't ready for. The way my dog rests his 
            head on my lap when I'm having a bad day like he just knows. The way he waits by the door before I even get home. No human has ever been that consistently happy to see me.
            It's this stupid, simple, unconditional thing that no amount of animated movies could ever fully capture because it's real and it's sitting right next to me on the couch,
            snoring.</p>
